Setup:

1. Paste all of the following into your terminal prompt at your root directory, this is to install Homebrew which works like “npm” for your computer and is used for compiling native applications:  https://brew.sh/

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


2. After installing brew with the above command line, please download xcode from the apple appstore, this will take a lot of memory and takes a longtime to install. The reason for downloading xcode is that the project needs to run on an emulator since this is no longer a web application anymore.

3. clone the repo and change directory into the repo, run npm i. Once you've installed node modules, to run the application on xcode, please use the following command: 
		npx react-native run-ios 

4. Documentation for react native : https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
